# Sociopedia

This is a social media fullstack app build using MERN stack i.e. MongodB, Express, React and Node. For styling and design it using Material UI V5.
This is just a simple app in whose login page you should enter your Username and Password to login (If you already have account) and register if you don't.

After you login or register you see a full home page where there is Header in the top. Th the left there is profile information, 
in the middle is where you can post and in the right is some sponsers and friendlist.

# Header 

 At the header, title and Search(For now we don't have search) in the left. Then in the right side we have theme toggle (Dark and light) 
 and all other features are disabled for now. Finally, we have dropdown menu for username and logout.
